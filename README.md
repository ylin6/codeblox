#CodeBlox
CodeBlox is an educational app/fun game built for iOS 9.0 and above. The app allows the user to choose different coding puzzles they would like to solve by unscrambling the lines of code into the appropriate order. The user can select from one of three difficulty levels to see the various puzzles available and read a short description about them. Once the user selects a puzzle they are presented with a TableView they must unscramble to make the code compile correctly. Once finished the user can submit their attempt and if it compiles correctly they are presented with a score and the time it took them to beat the puzzle.

To run the app simply download the full project and build it in XCode using the simulator for an iOS 9.0 device or higher or a physical device.
